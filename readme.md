# Eating Schedule Reminder of HKUST

## Data source

We sample data from [**Pulse of HKUS**](http://pulse-api.hkustvis.org/). 

## Notification APP setup

We use [Bark](https://github.com/Finb/Bark). Setup and installation can be found in their repo.

You can pass your Bark key by creating a file named `barkKey.py` with a single line inside:

```python
barkKey = "Your_Bark_Key"
```
